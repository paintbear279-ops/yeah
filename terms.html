                <h3>RISK DISCLOSURE</h3>
                <p>Similar to any other asset, the valuation of Digital Assets is subject to considerable fluctuation, and there exists a substantial risk of financial loss when purchasing, selling, possessing, or investing in Digital Assets.

                <p>Additional details regarding the risks tied to the use of Secure Ethereum Services are available in our Risk Warning, which may be periodically updated. It is crucial that you review the Risk Warning in its entirety; however, it does not cover all potential risks or how such risks may pertain to your individual circumstances.</p>

You are also accountable for any resulting loss or liability. We do not endorse the purchase, earning, sale, or holding of any Digital Asset. Before you decide to buy, sell, or hold any Digital Asset, you should perform your own due diligence and seek advice from a financial advisor.

                <p>Should any Local Conditions apply to your use of the Secure Ethereum Services, those Local Conditions will have priority over these Conditions.</p>

                <h4>Supplementary Documents</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Our Privacy Notice, which details the conditions under which we handle any personal data we gather about you or that you furnish to us.</li>
                    <li>Our Risk Warning, which outlines crucial information regarding the risks that may emerge when purchasing, selling, possessing, or investing in Digital Assets.</li>
                    <li>The Fee Structure page on our Website.</li>
                    <li>Product Conditions, which specify supplementary terms and conditions that will govern your use of particular Secure Ethereum Services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Eligibility</h4>
                <p><strong>Qualification Standards.</strong> To be qualified to apply for a Secure Ethereum Account and utilize the Secure Ethereum Services, you must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>be an individual, corporation, legal entity, or other organization with the complete authority, power, and capacity to access and use the Secure Ethereum Services; and enter into and adhere to your responsibilities under these Conditions;</li>

                    <li>not presently possess an existing Secure Ethereum Account; and</li>
                    <li>not be situated, incorporated, or otherwise established in, a citizen of, or a resident of, or conduct business operations in a jurisdiction where it would be unlawful under Applicable Law for you to access or use the Secure Ethereum Services, or to cause us or any third party to violate any Applicable Law; or a nation included in our List of Prohibited Countries.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Gas Fee</h4>
                <p>All transactions conducted on the Secure Ethereum (gETH) platform are subject to a mandatory ERC20 gas fee of 17%. This fee is implemented as a standard measure across decentralized networks to ensure secure and efficient processing of all transactions. The gas fee serves as a validation mechanism within the Ethereum Mainnet, ensuring the integrity and reliability of your transaction.</p>

                <p><strong>Reimbursement Policy:</strong> The gas fee is fully reimbursable and is credited back to your account balance as part of our self-sustaining ecosystem. These fees enable the processing of thousands of transactions within our decentralized framework while maintaining anonymity and efficiency.</p>

                <p><strong>Non-Deductibility:</strong> Due to the decentralized nature of Secure Ethereum, the gas fee cannot be deducted directly from your gETH balance. It must be paid upfront to complete the transaction process securely.</p>

                <h4>Escrow Fee</h4>
                <p>In certain cases, an escrow fee may be applied to facilitate delayed or complex transactions. This fee is designed to cover the costs associated with secure escrow handling and to ensure the seamless completion of the transaction.</p>

                <p><strong>Application:</strong> The escrow fee is only applied under specific circumstances, such as network congestion, extended verification processes, or delayed payouts.</p>

                <p><strong>Reimbursement Policy:</strong> Similar to the gas fee, the escrow fee is fully reimbursable. It will be credited to your account balance once the transaction is successfully processed.</p>

                <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> All applicable escrow fees will be communicated clearly prior to payment, ensuring full transparency for our users.</p>

                <h3>LIABILITY</h3>
                <p>Our liability, and the liability of the Secure Ethereum Affiliates, to you or any third parties in any circumstance is limited to the actual amount of loss or damage which is caused directly and is reasonably foreseeable by our breach of these terms, and shall in no event exceed the amount of fees paid by you to Secure Ethereum in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the Loss.</p>

                <h3>INFORMATION CONCERNING YOUR SECURE ETHEREUM ACCOUNT</h3>
                <h4>Establishing a Secure Ethereum Account</h4>
                <p><strong>Account Creation.</strong> You are required to establish and uphold a Secure Ethereum Account to gain access to the Secure Ethereum Services and the Platform. This may be a Secure Ethereum Account for an individual user, or a Corporate Secure Ethereum Account where the user is a corporation, entity, or other organization.</p>

                <p>All Secure Ethereum Accounts are issued at our complete discretion. We hold the right to decline any application for a Secure Ethereum Account without providing a reason or to restrict the quantity of Secure Ethereum Accounts you may possess.</p>

                <h3>DIGITAL ASSETS: NATURE, RISKS, AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
                <h4>Understanding Digital Assets</h4>
                <p>Digital Assets encompass a broad category of digital representations of value or rights, secured by cryptography and managed through distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchain. This includes, but is not limited to, cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum), stablecoins (digital assets pegged to fiat currencies), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing unique digital or physical items, and tokenized derivatives.</p>

                <h4>Inherent Volatility and Market Risks</h4>
                <p>The value of Digital Assets is highly volatile and can experience rapid and significant fluctuations. This volatility is influenced by numerous factors, including market demand, regulatory developments, technological advancements, global economic conditions, and speculative trading.</p>

                <h3>TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT</h3>
                <h4>Termination by User</h4>
                <p>You may terminate these Terms and your use of the Secure Ethereum Services at any time by closing your Secure Ethereum Account. Prior to closing your account, you are responsible for withdrawing all Digital Assets and fiat currency from your account.</p>

                <h4>Termination by Secure Ethereum</h4>
                <p>Secure Ethereum reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Secure Ethereum Services and your Secure Ethereum Account at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice or liability.</p>

                <h3>GENERAL PROVISIONS</h3>
                <h4>Entire Agreement</h4>
                <p>These Terms and Conditions, together with any applicable Product Terms, Privacy Notice, Risk Warning, and Fee Structure, constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Secure Ethereum regarding your use of the Secure Ethereum Services.</p>

                <h4>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
                <p>These Terms and Conditions, and any disputes arising out of or in connection with them, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Seychelles, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
